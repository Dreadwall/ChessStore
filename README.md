67272 Chess Store Project
===
This is my final project from 67-272. 
The focus on this project was to develop a full bodied web application that would act as an ecomerce store for chess. We had to develop the database, and build up each of the models, controllers, and views for the project as well as a functioning cart and checkout process.
